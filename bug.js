The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the promise resolves. This typically happens when you try to access data from a query snapshot immediately after calling `get()` or `onSnapshot()`.  The data isn't available synchronously; you need to handle the promise's resolution.
